# Lesson 11: Risk Management

## 🎯 Core Concept: Understanding DeFi Risks

Code is law in DeFi, but code can be flawed. Understanding and managing risks is essential for safely participating in DeFi.

## 📚 Types of Risks

### Smart Contract Risk

Code can have bugs. Even audited contracts can have vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**: Use well-audited, time-tested protocols. Start with small amounts.

### Oracle Risk

Smart contracts rely on oracles for price data. If oracles are manipulated, protocols can be exploited.

**Mitigation**: Protocols using multiple oracles are safer than single-oracle protocols.

### Governance Risk

Many protocols are governed by DAOs. If governance is compromised, protocols can be drained.

**Mitigation**: Understand governance structures. Be wary of highly centralized governance.

### Liquidation Risk

In lending protocols, positions can be liquidated if collateral value drops.

**Mitigation**: Monitor health factors. Don't max out borrowing capacity.

### Impermanent Loss

Liquidity providers face impermanent loss when token prices diverge.

**Mitigation**: Understand IL before providing liquidity. Consider stablecoin pairs.

### Interactive DeFi Risk Assessment

Use this interactive tool to assess risks across different DeFi protocols:

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Multiple Risk Types**: DeFi has many risk vectors beyond smart contract bugs
2. **Due Diligence**: Always research protocols before using them
3. **Start Small**: Test with small amounts first
4. **Diversify**: Don't put all funds in one protocol
5. **Stay Informed**: Follow protocol updates and security news
